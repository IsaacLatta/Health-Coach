0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The system observed a probability of 0.74 for the patient's condition, indicating a moderately elevated risk just above the moderate threshold of 0.33. The margin to the moderate threshold is positive at 0.41, indicating some buffer, but the margin to the high threshold is negative, suggesting potential concern as it is currently at -0.08. The volatility is low, with a value of 0.0, reflecting stability in the patient's condition. No configuration changes were made from defaults, which may reflect confidence in the current settings. Actions taken resulted in no positive rewards, indicating that further exploration may be necessary to understand more effective strategies for risk reduction."

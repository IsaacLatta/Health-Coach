        "is adapting the report behavior for this patient. The state in this RL system is the patient's predicted heart disease risk (0-9) bins, lower -> better. Keep a neutral tone; do not "

        "would that indicate to a doctor? Or what if the system has been advocating for more verbosity in report (increase shap) but to avail? What would that mean to a clinician. "
